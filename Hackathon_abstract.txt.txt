AIRLINES ON-TIME PERFORMANCE - MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS:

Abstract:

	The main aim of this system is to provide the analytical report to users or retailers(Makemytrip,Cleartrip etc.,)
about the past or present running status of the airline between the given stations. The past records of the schedules includes
timing details,isuues about the particular airline,user reviews on any particular date selected. The current running status 
of any particular airline can also be checked.

Technical Description:

	We are developing the system in Android Platform. The records mentioned above are stored in a Database. We are using
the concepts of ORM and DAO for retrieving the contents from the Database to efficeintly fetch and display it on the Android
app. The live running status of the airline is fed to the server live which is retrieved by the Android app instantaneously.

Benefits:

	The user has the advantage of booking a better airline by analysing the past records provided by the app. Also the 
retailer who gets access to this information could have a upperhand in the market by attracting the customers with past 
records and live status of the airlines.
