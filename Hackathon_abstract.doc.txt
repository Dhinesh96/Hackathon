TOPIC: AIRLINES ON-TIME PERFORMANCE - MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS

Abstract:

	The main aim of this system is to provide the analytical report to users or retailers(Makemytrip,Cleartrip etc.,)about the past or present running status of the airline between the given stations. The past records of the schedules includes timing details,isuues about the particular airline,user reviews on any particular date selected. The current running status of any particular airline can also be checked.

Technical Description:

	We are developing the system in Android Platform. The records mentioned above are stored in a Database. We are using the concepts of ORM(Object Relational Mapping) and DAO(Data Access Object) for retrieving the contents from the Database to efficeintly fetch and display it on the Android app. The live running status of the airline is fed to the server live which is retrieved by the Android app instantaneously.

Performance Analysis:

	The performance of the airline is analysed based on the following categories:

		1. Arrival and departure punctuality. 
		2. User Experience about their travel.
		3. Detailed information about pilot's backgrounds and his experience on aviation. 
		4. History of the particular airline (Technological improvements,Number of general aviaiton accidents occured etc.,)
 
Benefits:

	The user has the advantage of booking a better airline by analysing the past records provided by the app. Also the retailer who gets access to this information could have a upperhand in the market by attracting the customers with past records and live status of the airlines.
